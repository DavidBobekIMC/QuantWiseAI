abstract="A rolling analysis of a time series model is often used to assess the model's stability over time. When analyzing financial time series data using a statistical model, a key assumption is that the parameters of the model are constant over time. However, the economic environment often changes considerably, and it may not be reasonable to assume that a model's parameters are constant. A common technique to assess the constancy of a model's parameters is to compute parameter estimates over a rolling window of a fixed size through the sample. If the parameters are truly constant over the entire sample, then the estimates over the rolling windows should not be too different. If the parameters change at some point during the sample, then the rolling estimates should capture this instability.",

abstract = {The purpose of predictive stock price systems is to provide abnormal returns for financial market operators and serve as a basis for risk management tools. Although the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that it is not possible to anticipate market movements consistently, the use of computationally intensive systems that employ machine learning algorithms is increasingly common in the development of stock trading mechanisms. Several studies, using daily stock prices, have presented predictive system applications trained on fixed periods without considering new model updates. In this context, this study uses a machine learning technique called Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict stock prices for large and small capitalisations and in three different markets, employing prices with both daily and up-to-the-minute frequencies. Prediction errors are measured, and the model is compared to the random walk model proposed by the EMH. The results suggest that the SVR has predictive power, especially when using a strategy of updating the model periodically. There are also indicative results of increased predictions precision during lower volatility periods.}

abstract = {RSI is a commonly used indicator preferred by stock traders. However, even though it works well when the market is trendless, during bull or bear market conditions (when there is a clear trend) its performance degrades. In this study, we developed a trading model using a modified RSI using trend-removed stock data. The model has several parameters including, the trend detection period, RSI buy-sell trigger levels and periods. These parameters are optimized using genetic algorithms; then the trading performance is compared against B&H and standard RSI indicator usage. 9 different ETFs are selected for evaluating trading performance. The results indicate there is a performance improvement both in profit and success rates using this new model. As future work, other indicators might be modelled in a similar fashion in order to see if it is possible to find one indicator that can work under any market condition.}
